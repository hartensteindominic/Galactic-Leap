# AgentLens — Colorful AI Product Review Reassurance Experience

This repository includes a visually polished front-end website for product teams that want to turn customer reviews into trust-building AI conversations.

## What it includes

- A high-impact, colorful landing page designed to be easy to present and sell.
- Product review workflow messaging focused on reassurance and conversion.
- An interactive demo where a customer submits a product-specific review.
- Three AI response personas (Empathy, Trust, and Value) that comment and reassure buyers.
- Fully static files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) that can be hosted anywhere.

## Run locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open `http://localhost:4173` in your browser.

## Legacy helper script

The existing Linux helper script for running a Python AI agent is still available:

```bash
chmod +x agent_manager.sh
./agent_manager.sh start
./agent_manager.sh status
```
