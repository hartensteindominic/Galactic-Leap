# ASI Companion — Autonomous 3D AI Agent Landing Experience

This repository now ships a polished single-page experience for an **autonomous 3D AI companion** concept.

## Highlights

- Cinematic, futuristic interface with aurora gradients and adaptive glassmorphism UI.
- 3D human-style avatar composed with CSS and animated with subtle motion.
- "Autonomy sandbox" where users submit a mission and receive a simulated agent cycle:
  - planning,
  - self-approval policy checks,
  - reflective learning output.
- Live runtime metrics to reinforce always-on operation and self-improvement.

## Local run

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open `http://localhost:4173`.
