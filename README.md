# AgentLens — Advanced AI Agents Product Review Website

This repository now includes a visually polished front-end website designed to help people review products using specialized AI agents.

## What it includes

- A high-impact landing page with modern UI styling and gradients.
- Product-review focused sections describing AI capabilities.
- A small interactive demo that generates a sample multi-agent review summary.
- Fully static files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) that can be hosted anywhere.

## Run locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open `http://localhost:4173` in your browser.

## Legacy helper script

The existing Linux helper script for running a Python AI agent is still available:

```bash
chmod +x agent_manager.sh
./agent_manager.sh start
./agent_manager.sh status
```
